Each engineer writes the unit tests for their own features.

## Data structure
- Tickets are stored in one Python list of dictionaries.
- Each ticket has: id, title, category, urgency, affected_users, priority, status, assigned_to.
- The list is passed into every function as an argument. There are no global variables.

## Function contracts
- create_ticket(tickets, title, category, urgency, affected_users): adds and returns the new ticket.
- assign_ticket(tickets, ticket_id, staff_name): returns the updated ticket.
- change_status(tickets, ticket_id, new_status): returns the updated ticket.
- reopen_ticket(tickets, ticket_id): returns the updated ticket.
- get_work_queue(tickets): returns a new sorted list.
- build_report(tickets): returns a dictionary of counts.
- load_tickets(path) and save_tickets(tickets, path): only storage.py touches files.
- Invalid input raises an exception with a clear message. The CLI catches it and prints it.
- Only the CLI calls input(), so the other functions can be tested without typing.

## Rules we agreed on
- Category, urgency and status are case-insensitive and whitespace is trimmed.
- affected_users must be a positive whole number.
- Priority rules are checked in order and the first match wins.
- Workflow: open -> in_progress -> resolved. A ticket must be assigned before in_progress.
- A resolved ticket cannot be changed until it is reopened (reopen sets it to open).
- Work queue: <decide: open only, or open + in_progress>, ordered critical -> low, ties by earlier ID number.
- Next ticket ID = highest existing ID number + 1, so IDs stay unique after reload.
- Missing JSON file = fresh start. Malformed JSON = clear error, and the file is not overwritten.
- Bad input values (blank staff name, unknown status, affected_users of 0, invalid category or urgency) raise ValidationError.
- Valid input that the ticket's current state does not allow (assigning or changing a resolved ticket, moving an unassigned ticket to in_progress, moving to a status out of order, reopening a ticket that is not resolved) raise InvalidTransitionError.
- Unknown ticket IDs raise TicketNotFoundError.
- Check order inside a function: find the ticket first (TicketNotFoundError), then validate the input (ValidationError), then check the ticket's state (InvalidTransitionError).

## Branch plan
- Branch names: feat/1-ticket-creation, feat/3-assign-ticket, and so on.
- Branches start from the same main and use different files.
- The first approved PR merges first. The second engineer then updates their branch from main, reruns the tests, and gets re-approval before merging.
